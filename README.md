# BirthcontrolBot

This Telegram bot will remind you to take your birthcontrol on a daily basis.
It also takes cycle times into account, so you will not get notifications if you don't have to take your pill.
The bot is currently hosted at [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
It can be reached at [@BirthcontrolBot](https://t.me/birthcontrol_bot)


## Usage

3. Replace the token in `bot.py`
4. Run `server.py`
